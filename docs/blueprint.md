# **App Name**: PipeLine Daily

## Core Features:

- Structured Data Entry: Allow foremen to input daily project data: GPS location, project ID, weather conditions, manpower details, equipment hours, materials usage, progress updates, potential risks, and attached photographic evidence. The tool must use reason to avoid adding unnecessary or potentially incorrect information.
- Offline Data Sync: Enable offline data entry capabilities, automatically syncing to the cloud when internet connectivity is restored.
- Automated Report Generation: Auto-generate QA-compliant PDF reports from daily inputs, incorporating images and progress metrics. Use AI to intelligently summarize key observations. The tool should incorporate the location, time and weather into the QA-compliant report to help provide maximum detail with minimum data entry
- Digital Signatures: Incorporate a digital signature component for foremen, with timestamping for compliance.
- Role-Based Access: Implement role-based access control, distinguishing between foreman and admin/PM privileges.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep Teal (#2A9D8F) to convey trust and stability, crucial for engineering applications.
- Secondary color: Light Gray (#E5E5E5) for backgrounds to ensure content legibility.
- Accent: Safety Orange (#FF4500) for alerts, errors, and crucial interactive elements requiring immediate attention.
- Clean and readable sans-serif fonts to ensure clarity and readability of data and reports.
- Mobile-first responsive design with a clear information hierarchy, ensuring seamless usage across devices.
- Use a consistent set of line icons related to civil engineering for intuitive navigation and feature recognition.
